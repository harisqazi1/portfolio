# Introduction

#### Currently a cybersecurity student at a University. Interested in ethical hacking in general, whether it is hardware or software. Enjoy doing CTF \(Capture-The-Flag\) cybersecurity challenges in my free time. Hope to become a Cybersecurity Professional post-graduation.

## CTFs I have worked on:

* National Cyber League
* Cyber Fire Puzzles \(Part of the Department of Energy's Cyberforce competition\)
* Hackthebox \(the individual challenges, and the machines\)
* PicoCTF
* HackThisSite
* CTFlearn
* NahamCon2021
* SANS CyberStart
* CYRIN Cyber Range
* U.S. Cyber Games Open CTF

## My Hacking Mentality: Everything is hackable, you just have to find the right vulnerability
