I ran **cat** on the file and it revealed to be some foreign characters:

After being lost for 10 minutes, I then had to look online for a solution. I then found it [here](https://github.com/xnomas/PicoCTF-2021-Writeups/blob/main/Transformation/README.md), and this led me to get the flag:

I was unable to submit the flag, for some reason. I referenced other works online as well, and I was unable to get the solution. I then found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNc7tVWBYgk) where it shows me that there is another way to get the solution as well. This led me to go to CyberChef and then to the "magic" section and then enter in my string or the encoded flag:

If you notice, in the image, I was able to get the flag.
